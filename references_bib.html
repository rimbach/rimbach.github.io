  abstract = {Functional iterations such as Newton's are a popular tool for polynomial root-finding. We consider realistic situation where some (e.g., better-conditioned) roots have already been approximated and where further computations is directed to the approximation of the remaining roots. Such a situation is also realistic for root by means of subdivision iterations. A natural approach of applying explicit deflation has been much studied and recently advanced by one of the authors of this paper, but presently we consider the alternative of implicit deflation combined with the mapping of the variable and reversion of an input polynomial. We also show another unexplored direction for substantial further progress in this long and extensively studied area. Namely we dramatically increase the local efficiency of root-finding by means of the incorporation of fast algorithms for multipoint polynomial evaluation and Fast Multipole Method.},

It is one of the first implementations of a near-optimal algorithm for complex roots. We describe some low level techniques for speeding up the algorithm. Its performance is compared with the well-known MPSolve library and Maple.},

  abstract = {Abstract Let C be a real plane algebraic curve defined by the resultant of two polynomials (resp. by the discriminant of a polynomial). Geometrically such a curve is the projection of the intersection of the surfaces P ( x , y , z ) = Q ( x , y , z ) = 0 (resp. P ( x , y , z ) = ∂ P ∂ z ( x , y , z ) = 0 ), and generically its singularities are nodes (resp. nodes and ordinary cusps). State-of-the-art numerical algorithms compute the topology of smooth curves but usually fail to certify the topology of singular ones. The main challenge is to find practical numerical criteria that guarantee the existence and the uniqueness of a singularity inside a given box B, while ensuring that B does not contain any closed loop of C . We solve this problem by first providing a square deflation system, based on subresultants, that can be used to certify numerically whether B contains a unique singularity p or not. Then we introduce a numeric adaptive separation criterion based on interval arithmetic to ensure that the topology of C in B is homeomorphic to the local topology at p. Our algorithms are implemented and experiments show their efficiency compared to state-of-the-art symbolic or homotopic methods. }

  abstract = {The goal of Point Distance Solving Problems is to find 2D or 3D placements of points knowing distances between some pairs of points. The common guideline is to solve them by a numerical iterative method (e.g. Newton--Raphson method). A sole solution is obtained whereas many exist. However the number of solutions can be exponential and methods should provide solutions close to a sketch drawn by the user. Geometric reasoning can help to simplify the underlying system of equations by changing a few equations and triangularizing it. This triangularization is a geometric construction of solutions, called construction plan. We aim at finding several solutions close to the sketch on a one-dimensional path defined by a global parameter-homotopy using a construction plan. Some numerical instabilities may be encountered due to specific geometric configurations. We address this problem by changing on-the-fly the construction plan. Numerical results show that this hybrid method is efficient and robust.},
