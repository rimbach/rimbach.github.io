abstract = {Evaluating or finding the roots of a polynomial f(z) = f0 + ⋅⋅⋅ + fdzd with floating-point number coefficients is a ubiquitous problem. By using a piecewise approximation of f obtained with a careful use of the Newton polygon of f, we improve state-of-the-art upper bounds on the number of operations to evaluate and find the roots of a polynomial. In particular, if the coefficients of f are given with m significant bits, we provide for the first time an algorithm that finds all the roots of f with a relative condition number lower than 2m, using a number of bit operations quasi-linear in the bit-size of the floating-point representation of f. Notably, our new approach handles efficiently polynomials with coefficients ranging from 2− d to 2d, both in theory and in practice.},

abstract="Functional iterations such as Newton's are a popular tool for polynomial root-finding. We consider realistic situation where some (e.g., better-conditioned) roots have already been approximated and where further computations is directed to the approximation of the remaining roots. Such a situation is also realistic for root by means of subdivision iterations. A natural approach of applying explicit deflation has been much studied and recently advanced by one of the authors of this paper, but presently we consider the alternative of implicit deflation combined with the mapping of the variable and reversion of an input polynomial. We also show another unexplored direction for substantial further progress in this long and extensively studied area. Namely we dramatically increase the local efficiency of root-finding by means of the incorporation of fast algorithms for multipoint polynomial evaluation and Fast Multipole Method.",

abstract="We report an ongoing work on clustering algorithms for complex roots of a univariate polynomial p of degree d with real or complex coefficients. As in their previous best subdivision algorithms our root-finders are robust even for multiple roots of a polynomial given by a black box for the approximation of its coefficients, and their complexity decreases at least proportionally to the number of roots in a region of interest (ROI) on the complex plane, such as a disc or a square, but we greatly strengthen the main ingredient of the previous algorithms. We build the foundation for a new counting test that essentially amounts to the evaluation of a polynomial p and its derivative {\$}{\$}p'{\$}{\$}, which is a major benefit, e.g., for sparse polynomials p. Moreover with evaluation at about {\$}{\$}{\backslash}log (d){\$}{\$}points (versus the previous record of order d) we output correct number of roots in a disc whose contour has no roots of p nearby. Our second and less significant contribution concerns subdivision algorithms for polynomials with real coefficients. Our tests demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithms.",

abstract = "Abstract Let C be a real plane algebraic curve defined by the resultant of two polynomials (resp. by the discriminant of a polynomial). Geometrically such a curve is the projection of the intersection of the surfaces P ( x , y , z ) = Q ( x , y , z ) = 0 (resp. P ( x , y , z ) = ∂ P ∂ z ( x , y , z ) = 0 ), and generically its singularities are nodes (resp. nodes and ordinary cusps). State-of-the-art numerical algorithms compute the topology of smooth curves but usually fail to certify the topology of singular ones. The main challenge is to find practical numerical criteria that guarantee the existence and the uniqueness of a singularity inside a given box B, while ensuring that B does not contain any closed loop of C . We solve this problem by first providing a square deflation system, based on subresultants, that can be used to certify numerically whether B contains a unique singularity p or not. Then we introduce a numeric adaptive separation criterion based on interval arithmetic to ensure that the topology of C in B is homeomorphic to the local topology at p. Our algorithms are implemented and experiments show their efficiency compared to state-of-the-art symbolic or homotopic methods. "
